# 📘 SeriesSum (Java Program)

## 📌 Description
This Java program calculates the **sum of a series of natural numbers** from `1` to `n`.

The user provides a value for `n`, and the program computes the sum:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

This program is ideal for beginners who are learning:
- Loops in Java
- User input using `Scanner`
- Basic arithmetic operations

## 🧠 How the Program Works
1. The program asks the user to enter a number `n`.
2. It initializes a variable `sum` with value `0`.
3. A `for` loop runs from `1` to `n`.
4. Each number is added to `sum`.
5. Finally, the total sum is displayed.
